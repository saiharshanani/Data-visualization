# Exploring the crime occurrences over Minnesota

The primary goal of the project is to create an interactive visualisation between the volume and effects of crime in the city of Minnesota through the year 2010 to 2016. 
The data-set includes attributes like time, date and location of crime, nearest neighbourhoods, address of the site of the crime. 
The goal is to address several questions about the crimes that occur in the city of Minnesota, find the relationship between multiple attributes that constitute the crime-rate dataset. 
We posed a few questions that we are interested in finding about the city of Minnesota from the crime-rate dataset.
